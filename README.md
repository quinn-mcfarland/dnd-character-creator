# dnd-character-creator
A beginner friendly program meant to help create new characters for Dungeons and Dragons.
Note from me: I'm not actively supporting this. This concept is in its infancy, has legacy code from another site, of which is janky currently, not to mention the SDL 2 learning curve, and some research to implement every single feature I had planned currently.
Oh, and licensing. I'm not sure which license to put this under since current programs i'm researching all have different licenses.
